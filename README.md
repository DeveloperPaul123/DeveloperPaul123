### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Paul, a software engineer based out of the United States. 

:books: As a self taught developer, I'm constantly looking for ways to challenge myself and expand my skills. Life long learning is a must in the field of software (in my opion). 

### Projects

I work on a wide variety of projects, most of them open source. I've benefited a great deal from open source software, so I think it's important to give back to the community however I can. Be sure to check out my repos and follow me to keep up with everything!
